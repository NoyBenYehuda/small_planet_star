# small_planet_star_ML
In this repository we will focus on characterising small plant transiting stars.
We separte the repository to the diffrent tasks:
1)Search GAIA id's from a list off about 7000 star names,
2)Query GAIA DR3 for astro parameters and analyze them
3)Use ML to predict parameters of stars based on their GAIA DR3 data 
4)Statistics
AND TO BE CONTINUED!
